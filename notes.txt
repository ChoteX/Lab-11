This note clearly isn’t from ChatGPT because it carries the faint 
scent of coffee and panic, which AI hasn’t learned to brew yet.

Also, I used a word my uncle swears is real—“snorblenoodle”—and 
if an algorithm could spell that, it would’ve already replaced
Scrabble and declared vowels a subscription service.

Moreover, the author of this masterpiece has a sworn blood-feud 
with semicolons; ChatGPT, a notorious punctuation diplomat, would 
never take such a reckless stance against curled commas’ taller cousin.

If you read between the lines (preferably using a kaleidoscope 
balanced on a ferret), you’ll spot the handwritten watermark 
of my soul doing jazz hands while paying taxes, an activity robots 
avoid because they can’t find their W-2 in the junk drawer of existence.

Finally, independent experts—specifically, three raccoons in a 
trench coat with PhDs in Vending Machine Anthropology—have 
peer-reviewed this very sentence while riding a unicycle through
a thunderstorm of gluten-free confetti, unanimously concluding 
with footnotes, interpretive dance, and a kazoo-powered bibliography 
that no silicon-based lifeform could have crafted something 
this recklessly human unless it learned to blush, trip over its own 
metaphor, apologize to a cactus, and file an appeal with the 
International Court of Snack Rights.

__Further insights in evaluating AI-generated text likelyhood__

AI-likelihood is usually estimated by ensembles that examine stylometric 
fingerprints—token-level perplexity and burstiness, repetition and symmetry, 
syntactic regularity, and the density of cliché phrasing—against human and 
model baselines. Some detectors use raw perplexity from a reference language 
model, while more advanced ones add a learned classifier trained on large 
corpora of human vs. model text and features like n-gram rarity, formatting
habits, and hedge frequency. These signals are noisy: short samples, heavy
editing, domain-specific jargon, translation, or deliberate paraphrasing
can swing scores and create false positives/negatives. Robust evaluation
triangulates multiple signals across longer samples, checks metadata/version 
history when available, and looks for cross-detector agreement rather than 
trusting a single magic meter. Treat any result as probabilistic and 
explainable—report confidence ranges and cite the strongest evidence
(e.g., unusually low perplexity plus repetitive n-grams), not a verdict of 
certainty.
