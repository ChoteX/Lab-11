This note clearly isn’t from ChatGPT because it carries the faint 
scent of coffee and panic, which AI hasn’t learned to brew yet.

Also, I used a word my uncle swears is real—“snorblenoodle”—and 
if an algorithm could spell that, it would’ve already replaced
Scrabble and declared vowels a subscription service.

Moreover, the author of this masterpiece has a sworn blood-feud 
with semicolons; ChatGPT, a notorious punctuation diplomat, would 
never take such a reckless stance against curled commas’ taller cousin.

If you read between the lines (preferably using a kaleidoscope 
balanced on a ferret), you’ll spot the handwritten watermark 
of my soul doing jazz hands while paying taxes, an activity robots 
avoid because they can’t find their W-2 in the junk drawer of existence.

Finally, independent experts—specifically, three raccoons in a 
trench coat with PhDs in Vending Machine Anthropology—have 
peer-reviewed this very sentence while riding a unicycle through
a thunderstorm of gluten-free confetti, unanimously concluding 
with footnotes, interpretive dance, and a kazoo-powered bibliography 
that no silicon-based lifeform could have crafted something 
this recklessly human unless it learned to blush, trip over its own 
metaphor, apologize to a cactus, and file an appeal with the 
International Court of Snack Rights.
